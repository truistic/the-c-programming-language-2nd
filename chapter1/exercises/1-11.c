/*
 * How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?
 */

//To test the word count program first try no input.
//The output should be: 0 0 0 (zero newlines. zero words, zero characters).

//Then try a one-character word.
//The output should be: 1 1 2 (one newline. one word, two characters-a letter followed by a newline character).

//Then try a two-character word.
//The output should be: 1 1 3 (one newline. one word. three characters-two characters followed by a newline character).

//In addition, try 2 one-character words (the output should be: 1 2 4)
// and 2 one-character words-one word per line (the output should be 2 2 4).

//The kinds of input most likely to uncover bugs are those that test boundary conditions.

//Some boundaries are:
// - no input
// - no words -- just newlines
// - no words -- just blanks. tabs. and newlines
// - one word per line -- no blanks and tabs
// - word starting at the beginning of the line
// - word starting after some blanks
